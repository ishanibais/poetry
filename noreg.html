            On that plate was a beautiful triangle<br>
With veggies all around and cheese oozing out,<br> as if shouting and compelling me to eat it.<br>
Every second spent in gym,<br>
Every sacrifice my tastebuds have made,<br>
Stopped me, my heart and my hands.<br>
But that damm triangle was at its best,<br>
It was wanting love from me,<br>
And just a little gaze I could give!<br>
Oh yes I have strong heart...I didn't eat<br>
Because I would never want to regret eating that <br>little triangle with veggies all around <br>and cheese oozing out!<br><hr style="opacity: 0;">
