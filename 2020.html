            Hey 2020!<br>
You have come to an end now<br>
Your platter had many flavors,<br>
Everything from sweet to sour, from bitter to spicy <br>
You united some but separated others<br>
You had lessons for some and punishment for others <br>
We wished you to be a HAPPY new year,<br>
But your take on happiness was not same as ours!<br>
From the pandemic to wildfires,<br>
From floods to droughts,<br>
From quarantine time to family hours,<br>
From masked smiled to depression,<br>
From elections to economic recession.<br>
Oh dear! You were difficult af!<br>
And so,<br>
Roman gods were spotted together in the sky..<br>
To bid you a good Bye!<br><hr style="opacity: 0;">
